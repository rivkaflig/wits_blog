    <h3>What is Ransomware</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Imagine logging into your computer one day only to find that all your files—pictures, homework, 
        and even your favorite games—are locked. A scary message pops up saying you have to pay 
        money to get them back. This is ransomware, a type of malware (malicious software) used by 
        cybercriminals to extort money from victims.</p>

    <h3>A Brief History of Ransomware</h3>
    <p>Ransomware has come a long way since it first appeared. In 1989, the first ransomware, called 
        the AIDS Trojan, was distributed through floppy disks. The ransom? A payment sent by mail!
        Fast forward to the 2010s, and ransomware evolved to target businesses, hospitals, and even 
        government systems. Hackers started demanding payments in Bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency,
        because it’s harder to trace. One of the most infamous ransomware attacks, WannaCry in 2017,
        infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide in just a few days.
        Today, ransomware is more sophisticated. Hackers may threaten to leak sensitive data online if 
        the ransom isn’t paid. This double-threat tactic makes it even more dangerous.</p>

    <h3>How Does Ransomware Spread?</h3>
    <p>Ransomware can sneak into your system in many ways:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify">
        <li><b>Phishing Emails:</b> Hackers send fake emails designed to look legitimate, tricking you into 
            clicking a malicious link or downloading a harmful attachment. These emails often use 
            urgent or enticing language, like pretending to be from your bank or a popular service.</li>
        <li><b>Malicious Websites:</b> Some websites are set up specifically to install malware on your 
            device. These can be disguised as free download sites, pop-up ads, or even fake news 
            articles.</li>
        <li><b>Vulnerabilities:</b> When your software isn't updated, it can contain bugs or weak 
            points that hackers exploit to gain access to your system. Keeping your apps and 
            operating system up to date is critical to staying safe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
    <p>Here are some easy ways to keep ransomware out of your life:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Think Before You Click:</b> Don’t click on links or open attachments from unknown sources. 
            Always check if an email is legit by looking at the sender’s address. For example, an 
            email from your bank should come from an official domain like <a href="yourbank.com" target="_blank">yourbank.com</a>, not 
            something suspicious like <a href="yourbank-support123.net" target="_blank">yourbank-support123.net</a>. Also, hover over links to see 
            where they lead before clicking.</li>
        <li><b>Keep Software Updated:</b> Regularly update your operating system, browser, and apps to 
            fix security issues.</li>
        <li><b>Use Antivirus Software:</b> Install a reputable antivirus program and keep it updated.</li>
        <li><b>Backup Your Files:</b> Save important files to an external drive or cloud storage. This way, 
            you won’t lose them even if ransomware strikes.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid Public Wi-Fi:</b> Hackers often use public Wi-Fi networks to spread malware. Use a 
            VPN (Virtual Private Network) if you need to connect</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What If You’re Attacked?</h3>
    <p>If you ever become a victim of ransomware:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Don’t Pay the Ransom:</b> There’s no guarantee the hackers will unlock your files, and it 
            encourages them to keep attacking others.</li>
        <li><b>Disconnect Your Device:</b> Immediately unplug your device from the internet to stop the 
            malware from spreading.</li>
        <li><b>Report the Incident:</b> Contact a trusted organization and report the attack to authorities, 
            like the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank">FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> (https://www.ic3.gov/).</li>
    </ul>
